Teddy: It is so nice outside tonight!
Rowana: I am just happy to be here with you.
*rustle*
Teddy: Do you hear that?
Rowana: What? I didn't hear anything. You are probably tired.
Teddy: Ya... maybe.
Rowana: Alright, lemme set up the tent. 
                Can you set out the fire?
Teddy: Ok. Love you.
Rowana: I love myself too!
*few minutes later*
Rowana: Teddy where are you??
                I have to go find him!
